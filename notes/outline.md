# Outline

Problem: Want to identify what embeddings are useful for training and various vision tasks. We hypothesize that embeddings that more closely match neural representations are more powerful and generalizable.

Motivation: More deeply understand why our brain's visual neural representations are so powerful and capable of solving a wide range of tasks with limited data and training
